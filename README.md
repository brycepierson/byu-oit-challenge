I was not able to get the full thing working. I got the back end running but the hot refresh on my vue front-end was not working for some reason.  That slowed down my development a lot.

I spent about 2 hours just getting the two project skeletons set up. I have had no experience with any of these tools before. Once I got them set up, I started with the backend and got that API working before starting the front end.

To start back end:

DEBUG=webservice:* npm start

runs on localhost port 3000

To start front-end (not working):

yarn dev

runs on localhost port 8000
